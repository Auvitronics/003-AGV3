The primary need of Automated Guided Vehicle is to automate the process of transfering parts from production area to the storage area. There are six moulding machines in the production area and the production output of each machine should be taken to the store. The production area should not be used as the storage of the production part.\par The maximum utilization of production area is our basic concern.The production should be take care by the Automated guided vehicle.This help us to shape our production in organized way. \par Each machine have its own dedicated AGV which is responsible for transfering production of that particular machine to store.\par This project help us in reducing labour cost,consistency.Its also help us to move towards new technology and increase our company impression on our supplier and help us to motivate new supplier.
