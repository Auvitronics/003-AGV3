turning postioning jhatkay
- big motors will potentially solve the issue

do away with line-following (software engineer)
- inertial sensor
- existing camera systems for detection (possible collision avoidance)


six-wheels

collision:
- truck
- blind spot (corner, center)
- currently agv
- while turning false detection of hurdle
AVICS software 
- smart detection objectsss

Mechanical structure:
- wheel alignment
- structure (fibre glass)


tugging and carrying are two different things:

design 1: agv in-house , respondible for carrying
design 2: IMC , responsible for tugging
desgin 3: differential design, on paper, objectives unclear
